# Project Description

Development of a digital prototype for a startup in the holistic transformation sector. 
The project includes the conception and implementation of a responsive website with an integrated booking system for workshops in health, beauty, and fitness.
The platform targets two distinct audiences: private individuals and corporate clients. 
Founded as a partnership, the startup team combines expertise from styling, health, and fitness domains.
The prototype was implemented as a Progressive Web App (PWA) to ensure optimal usability across all devices.
